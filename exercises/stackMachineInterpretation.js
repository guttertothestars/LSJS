Stack Machine Interpretation

A stack is a list of values that grows and shrinks dynamically. A stack may be
implemented as an Array that uses two Array methods: Array.prototype.push and
Array.prototype.pop.

A stack-and-register programming language is a language that uses a stack of
values. Each operation in the language operates on a register, which can be
thought of as the current value. The register is not part of the stack. An
operation that requires two values pops the topmost item from the stack
(i.e., the operation removes the most recently pushed value from the stack),
operates on the popped value and the register value, and stores the result
back in the register.

This sounds complex, but the behavior is straightforward and easy to walk
through manually. Consider a MULT operation in a stack-and-register language.
It removes the value from the stack, multiplies the removed stack value with
the register value, then stores the result back in the register. For example,
if we start with a stack of [3, 6, 4] (where 4 is the topmost item in the stack)
and a register value of 7, the MULT operation mutates the stack to [3, 6]
(the 4 is removed), and the result of the multiplication, 28, is left in the
register. If we do another MULT at this point, the stack is mutated to [3], and
the register is left with the value 168.

Write a function that implements a miniature stack-and-register-based
programming language that has the following commands (also called operations or
  tokens):

    n : Place a value, n, in the register. Do not modify the stack.
    PUSH : Push the register value onto the stack. Leave the value in the
    register.
    ADD : Pop a value from the stack and add it to the register value, storing
    the result in the register.
    SUB : Pop a value from the stack and subtract it from the register value,
    storing the result in the register.
    MULT : Pop a value from the stack and multiply it by the register value,
    storing the result in the register.
    DIV : Pop a value from the stack and divide the register value by the popped
    stack value, storing the integer result back in the register.
    REMAINDER : Pop a value from the stack and divide the register value by the
    popped stack value, storing the integer remainder of the division back in
    the register.
    POP : Remove the topmost item from the stack and place it in the register.
    PRINT : Print the register value.

All operations are integer operations (which is only important with DIV and
REMAINDER).

Programs will be supplied to your language function via a string argument. Your
function may assume that all arguments are valid programs â€” i.e., they will not
do anything like trying to pop a non-existent value from the stack, and they
 won't contain any unknown tokens.

Initialize the stack and register to the values [] and 0, respectively.

Examples:

minilang('PRINT');
// 0

minilang('5 PUSH 3 MULT PRINT');
// 15

minilang('5 PRINT PUSH 3 PRINT ADD PRINT');
// 5
// 3
// 8

minilang('5 PUSH POP PRINT');
// 5

minilang('3 PUSH 4 PUSH 5 PUSH PRINT ADD PRINT POP PRINT ADD PRINT');
// 5
// 10
// 4
// 7

minilang('3 PUSH PUSH 7 DIV MULT PRINT');
// 6

minilang('4 PUSH PUSH 7 REMAINDER MULT PRINT');
// 12

minilang('-3 PUSH 5 SUB PRINT');
// 8

minilang('6 PUSH');
// (nothing is printed because the `program` argument has no `PRINT` commands)

Problem: create a function that will take an arbitrary number of arguments
and supply those arguments on a FIFO basis to switch statement that will parse
argument and use it to manupulate a stack array, and a register value.

Edge cases: any argument that isn't a number or a proper commmand.

Data Structures: integers, arrrays

Algo:

use a while loop that runs until the args array is empty
-use the first element as the switch  expression
-use the switch statement to manipulate the stack and register as appropriate
